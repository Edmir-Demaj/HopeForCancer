# HopeForCancer - Introduction

**Welcome to HopeForCancer**  
This is an informational blog webapp created using the Django Framework and related contemporary technologies, as a component of Portfolio Project 4 for my Diploma in Full Stack Software Development at Code Institute.

**Our Story**  
HopeForCancer is a web application that aims to raise awareness about cancer and provide resources to those affected by it. The idea for the project originated from a personal experience: the founder, **Edmir Demaj**, lost his father to cancer in November 2022. Recognizing the need for a comprehensive and user-friendly resource for those affected by cancer, Edmir set out to create a platform that would do just that. The mission of HopeForCancer is to provide support and information to cancer patients, survivors, and their families, and to spread awareness about the importance of early detection and prevention.
