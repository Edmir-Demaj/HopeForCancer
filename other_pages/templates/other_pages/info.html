        Cancer is a disease that occurs when abnormal cells in the body grow uncontrollably. These cells can form tumors
        or invade nearby tissues and spread to other parts of the body. While cancer can affect people of all ages, it
        is more common in older adults. Abnormal growth forming a lump is called tumour, this is true of all cancers
        except leukaemia (cancer of the
        blood). If left untreated, tumours can grow and spread into the surrounding normal tissue, or to other parts of
        the body via the bloodstream and lymphatic systems, and can affect the digestive, nervous and circulatory
        systems or release hormones that may affect body function.
