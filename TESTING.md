## Performance

### Google's Lighthouse Performance
To assess the performance of the website, the [Google Lighthouse](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse) tool was utilized. The website received a remarkable performance score of `99 on desktop devices`, indicating excellent performance. However, on mobile devices, the score was `88`, indicating room for improvement. The main contributing factor to this score was identified as the large size of user-uploaded images, which had a significant impact on performance. To address this issue, a future plan is to implement a feature that automatically converts images of any format to the more optimized WebP format.

During the evaluation process, the website underwent testing in various categories, including:
- Performance
- Accessibility
- Best practices
- SEO
- Progressive Web App
